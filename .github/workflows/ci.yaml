  # The ci-matrix job ends up as multiple jobs and therefore as multiple checks.
  # Each check's name ends up with the node version appended.
  # If we were to use those checks as required checks, we would have to occasionally bump them.
  # This job allows us to have a single check that we don't have to bump.
